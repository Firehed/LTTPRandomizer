# LTTPRandomizer OS X Port

This is an OS X variant of [Dessyreqt/alttprandomizer](https://github.com/Dessyreqt/alttprandomizer), written in Swift.

## Variations from the Windows version

* Seeds are not compatible, and compatibility is not a current goal.
  If you are a speedrunner looking to race a specific seed, you should use the "official" randomizer linked above.

## Variations from the original game

This uses the (currently v4) ROM from the Windows version, and has the same [variations](https://github.com/Dessyreqt/alttprandomizer#differences-from-the-normal-game)

## Motivation

I use [OpenEmu](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu) to play the old classics, and transferring files from a system running Windows to my Mac is rather tedious.

Mostly I wanted an interesting weekend project.
I may suck at playing Zelda, but hacking on it is a lot of fun.
